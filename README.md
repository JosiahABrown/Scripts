# Scripts
This repository is just a list of some of my personal shell scripts. The main goal of it is to learn more about scripting. 

Some of them require seperate packages so make sure to read the file before running it. 

**IT IS DANGEROUS TO RUN SCRIPTS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THEY DO FIRST**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository into whatever folder you desire
2. Give the scripts executable functionality
3. Go to your `.bashrc` or where ever you keep your aliases
4. `alias <command-name>='PATH/TO/FILE/script.sh'`

Now you should be able to run your scripts from anywhere in your system useing the alias you gave it!
